            Development of mechanisms for designing the processes of users&#39;
            vital activity into the ecosystem of their digital assistants

    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
    <p>
        Our project is aimed at stabilizing the psycho-emotional state of users
        through the personalization of artificial lighting in space. The
        determination of the psycho-emotional state is based on data from the
        ecosystem of digital assistants. The project consists of three software
        modules.
    </p>
    <h3 id="why">Why</h3>
    <p>
        It is necessary to use the software created within the framework of the
        project to personalize artificial lighting when using multiple luminaires
        by several users at the same time. It is also important to note that you
        can change the lighting parameters at will, and taking into account data
        about your psycho-emotional state.
    </p>
    <h3 id="for-whom">For whom</h3>
    <p>This software is necessary for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            people who want to improve or stabilize their psychoemotional state
        </li>
        <li>
            users who have adjustable luminaires or light sources who want to
            personalize their lighting (especially if several people want to change
            lighting settings)
        </li>
        <li>
            employers who want to increase the efficiency of employees and reduce
            the fatigue of their employees
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="software-modules">Software modules</h2>
    <p>
        The project consists of three software modules (each of which performs its
        own highly specialized tasks) to stabilize and normalize the
        psycho-emotional state of users:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Software module for localization of owners of digital assistants
                according to mobile device data</strong>
            (<a href="https://github.com/AndrewLaptev/ble_light_mobile">BLight</a>)
            - performs the tasks of determining the user&#39;s location to find the
            nearest light sources so that the user controls the nearest luminaires
            to him
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Software module for normalization of the psycho-emotional state and
                personalization of the environment through artificial lighting</strong>
            (<a href="https://github.com/AndrewLaptev/ble_light_esp32">BLightESP32</a>) - performs the tasks of
            controlling lighting parameters through
            changes in color temperature and luminous flux of the luminaire
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Software module for recognizing a psychoemotional state based on data
                from the ecosystem of digital assistants</strong>
            (<a href="https://github.com/TimurSamigulin/core-emotion">CoreEmotion</a>) - is designed to determine the
            user's psycho-emotional state by text
            messages exchanged between people in the Avatar ecosystem
        </li>
    </ul>
